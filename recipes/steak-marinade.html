    <p>
        I have no idea why people like eating steaks. They are literally just giant blocks of meat with some 
        cheap sauce on top. Maybe some peper as well if you are lucky. Like, if you want to eat meat, at least 
        have the audacity to eat properly cooked meat, intead of insulting mankind's greatest invention of 
        fire by eating raw meat and using knifes and forks to pretend like you're not a savage babarian.
